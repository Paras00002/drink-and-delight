Certainly, I'll explain each block of the HTML code you provided step by step:

```html
<br /><br />
```

These lines simply add two line breaks, creating some space between the top of the page and the subsequent content.

```html
<h1>Update Distributor</h1>
```

This line displays a level 1 heading "Update Distributor".

```html
<br />
```

This line adds a single line break, providing some spacing between the heading and the form.

```html
<div style="width: 900px">
```

This opens a `div` element with an inline style that sets the width of the `div` to 900 pixels. This is likely used to control the layout and appearance of the form.

```html
  <form #distributordetails="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
```

This line starts a `form` element.

- `#distributordetails="ngForm"` assigns a template reference variable `distributordetails` to the form and uses the `ngForm` directive to bind it. This allows you to access the form's properties and validation status in your component.
- `(ngSubmit)="onSubmit()"` sets up an event handler that calls the `onSubmit()` method when the form is submitted.

```html
    <div class="form-group">
      <label for="name">Name of Distributor : </label>
```

This creates a `div` with the class `form-group` and adds a label for the input field. The `for` attribute of the `label` is associated with the `id` of the input field it labels.

```html
      <input
        class="form-control"
        type="name"
        [(ngModel)]="distributor.name"
        name="name"
        required
        placeholder="Enter Distributor's Name"
        #name="ngModel"
        [class.is-invalid]="name.invalid && name.touched"
      />
```

This is an `input` field for the distributor's name.

- `class="form-control"` applies styling to the input to make it match the form's style.
- `type="name"` is not a standard HTML input type. It's likely meant to be a custom input type.
- `[(ngModel)]="distributor.name"` binds the input's value to the `distributor.name` property in the component. This allows two-way data binding between the input and the component.
- `name="name"` sets the name attribute of the input field.
- `required` attribute indicates that the input is required and must be filled out.
- `placeholder` provides a hint to the user about what should be entered.
- `#name="ngModel"` assigns a template reference variable `name` to the input element.
- `[class.is-invalid]="name.invalid && name.touched"` conditionally adds the class `is-invalid` to the input element when it is both invalid and has been touched by the user.

```html
      <div *ngIf="name.errors && name.invalid && name.touched">
        <small class="text-danger" *ngIf="name.errors?.['required']">Name is required field</small>
      </div>
```

This `div` contains error handling logic for the name input field. It uses Angular's structural directive `*ngIf` to conditionally render the `div` and its content if certain conditions are met.

- `*ngIf="name.errors && name.invalid && name.touched"` checks if the name input has errors, is invalid, and has been touched by the user.
- Inside the `div`, a `small` element with the class `text-danger` is shown if the `required` error is present (meaning the user didn't fill in the field).

This same pattern of code is repeated for the "Location" and "Phone number" input fields, adjusting the attributes and variable names accordingly.

```html
    <br />
```

This line adds a line break for spacing between the input fields and the submit button.

```html
    <button
      type="submit"
      [disabled]="distributordetails.invalid"
      class="btn btn-primary"
    >
      Submit
    </button>
```

This is a `button` element that serves as the submit button for the form.

- `type="submit"` indicates that clicking this button will submit the form.
- `[disabled]="distributordetails.invalid"` conditionally disables the button if the form is invalid, preventing submission.
- `class="btn btn-primary"` applies Bootstrap classes to style the button.
- The text "Submit" is displayed inside the button.

```html
  </form>
```

This closes the `form` element.

```html
</div>
```

This closes the `div` element with the inline style.

In summary, the provided HTML code represents a form for updating distributor details. It includes input fields for the distributor's name, location, and phone number. The form is styled using Bootstrap classes, and there are error messages displayed if the user tries to submit the form without filling in required fields. The form data is bound to a component using Angular's two-way data binding and form validation features.
